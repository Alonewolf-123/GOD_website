            <p>This event completely altered life as we knew it. Governments have
              been overthrown, and political hierarchy abolished. Multiple clans fight
              for supremacy in the Metaverse. A crazy high prize of $GOD is at
              stake. Welcome to Game of Dwarfs (GOD).</p>
            <p>Game of Dwarfs is a play-to-earn passive income game designed
              on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows investors to generate $GOD,
              which can be exchanged on other platforms, used to acquire more
              NFTs, or to buy in-game upgrades.</p>
            <p>No non-sense roadmaps, no empty promisses. Just a game ready to
              play at launch. On-chain, fully decentralized, completely autonomous.
              Made for the community, ruled by the players.</p>
