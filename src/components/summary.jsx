          <p>This unpredictable event completely altered life as we
            knew it. Governments have been overthrown, and political hierarchy abolished. Multiple clans fight for supremacy
            in the Metaverse. A crazy high prize of $GOD is at stake.

          <p>Game of Dwarfs is a play-to-earn passive income game
            designed on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows investors
            to generate $GOD, which can be exchanged on other platforms, used to acquire more NFTs, or to buy in-game upgrades.</p>
          <p>No non-sense roadmaps, no unrealistic promises. Just a
            game ready to play at launch. Fully on-chain, decentralized, completely autonomous. Made for the community,
            ruled by the players.</p>
