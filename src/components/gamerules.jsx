              <h2>GAME OF DWARFS</h2>
              <p>In a post-apocalyptic alternative universe, humanity was reduced to dwarf size. This
                unprecedented event utterly altered life as we knew it. Governments have been
                overthrown, and political hierarchy abolished. Multiple clans fight for supremacy in
                the Metaverse. A crazy high price of $GOD is at stake. Welcome to Game of Dwarfs
                (GOD).</p>
              {/* <p>Game of Dwarfs is a play-to-earn passive income game designed on the Ethereum
                blockchain. Fully on-chain, decentralized and completely autonomous. Made for the
                community, ruled by the players. It allows investors to generate $GOD, which can be
                used to acquire more NFTs, exchanged on other platforms, or buy in-game
                upgrades.</p> */}
              <p>Game of Dwarfs is a risk protocol P2E ecosystem designed on the Ethereum blockchain. As a holder, you will earn $GOD tokens as staking rewards. The decisions you make will impact the environment as a whole. Play it safe and earn your cut, or shoot for the moon and risk it all, the choice is yours.</p>
              <p>There are two types of people in this world; the Merchants who earn an honest living by
                running their businesses, and the Mobsters who use force to get what they want.
                Mobsters have struck a deal with the Merchants; they allow them to operate their
                business freely and protect them from other clans. In exchange, the Merchants must
                pay a 20% tax (Pizzo) to the mob clan controlling their city.</p>
              <p>Merchants have to pay the tax when they claim their earnings. Mobsters divide all the
                profit amongst themselves. The higher your rank amongst your mob clan, the more
                tokens you will accumulate.</p>
              <p>Merchants can also choose to invest in their business. All $GOD directly invested in a
                business is not taxed by the Mobsters. The more $GOD a merchant invests in his
                business, the more they will earn each day.</p>
              <p>For now, a peace treaty has been signed by all the Dwarfathers to maintain order
                and stability in the game. No one knows how long it will last, but if a Dwarfather
                breaks the peace, a clan war will begin.</p>

              <h3>IN $GOD WE TRUST</h3>
              <p>$GOD is the native token used within our ecosystem. You can use it to acquire NFTs
                during the drops of phase two, exchange it on other platforms, use it to play in the
                Casino or invest it in the game to increase the value of your NFT.</p>
              <p>The maximum $GOD supply is 10’000’000’000. The developers will receive
                1’000’000’000 $GOD. 1’190’000’000 $GOD will be allocated to the initial balance of
                Merchants. Gameplay rewards will be 4’810’000’000 $GOD. 1’000’000’000 $GOD will
                be available on the secondary market. Community rewards will be 2’000’000’000.</p>

              <h3>MINTING</h3>
              <p>Investors will have a 15% chance of getting a mobster and an 85% chance of getting a merchant. The mint will be divided into two distinct phases.</p>
              <h4>Phase one: Single drop of 8’000 NFTs</h4>
              <p>A total of 8'000 NFTs will be released during phase one. This makes a total of 1'200
                mobsters and 6'800 merchants available during the first drop. Each player will be able
                to mint up to 10 NFTs.</p>
              <p>Once phase one is sold out, the game will begin. The first phase will last for 45 days.
                During this time, players will accumulate $GOD that can be used to acquire more NFTs
                during phase two.</p>
              <h4>Phase two: Multiple drops</h4>
              <p>During the second phase of the project, a new NFT collection will be dropped every four weeks over a period of three months. Each drop will be based on a different theme. We will collaborate with talented artists on each drop.</p>
              <p>Half of the NFTs released during phase two will be exclusively sold in $GOD, the rest will be available in ETH. There is a limit of 1 NFT per player that can be minted in $GOD. Selling 50% in $GOD is our way to reward early investors. Selling 50% in ETH is a way to expand our community and make the game even more interesting. It is also a way to finance features that will be introduced later on.</p>

              <h3>MERCHANTS</h3>
              <p>You have an 85% chance of minting a merchant, each with its unique traits. Merchants
                earn $GOD by investing in their business (staking their NFTs). They earn a 1%
                daily interest on the amount of $GOD they have invested in their business.</p>
              <p>Example A: A merchant has 150’000 $GOD invested in his business. He earns a 1%
                daily interest, so he earns 1’500 $GOD every day.</p>
              <p>Example B: A merchant has 30’000 $GOD invested in his business. He earns a 1%
                daily interest, so he earns 300 $GOD every day.</p>
              <p>Each merchant minted during phase one will start the game with a balance of 100’000
                $GOD. Merchants minted during phase two will start with a balance of 50’000 $GOD.</p>
              <p>When they withdraw the $GOD invested in their business, Merchants must pay a 20%
                tax to the mobsters. However, some merchants have found a way to avoid the tax, but
                It’s a risky game. For every two merchants that tries the trick, only one succeeds
                and earns all his money. The other one comes back with an empty balance and a few
                bruises on his face.</p>

              <h3>THE CASINO</h3>
              <p>Merchants and Mobsters can play some of their $GOD in the casino. In order to
                participate, each player must place a bet of 1000 $GOD. Every player can gamble in the
                casino, no matter if the NFT they own is a merchant or a mobster. The probability of
                winning is 1%, and players can play once every 2 hours.</p>
              <p>Players who are lucky enough to win will receive a free NFT. They will be able mint it for
                free during the next upcoming drop. The random allocation probability stays the same:
                85% chance of getting a merchant and 15% chance of getting a mobster. The mobster
                can be of any rank.</p>
              <p>A total of 1500 NFTs will be available through the casino during phase 2 (500 before
                every drop of phase 2). In the case where not all 500 NFTs are won, the remaining will
                be sold in $GOD during the next upcoming mint.</p>
              <p>Example: only 450 NFTs are won through the casino before the first drop of phase 2.
                The 50 NFTs remaining will be sold in $GOD during the first mint of phase 2, along with
                the other 1500 NFTs sold in $GOD and 2000 sold in ETH.</p>
              <p>All $GOD collected through the Casino will be burnt. Players will be able to play the
                casino directly through our website.</p>
              <h3>MOBSTERS</h3>
              <p>You have a 15% chance of minting a mobster, each with unique traits, including a rank
                value ranging from Soldier to Dwarfathers: The higher the rank, the higher the
                portion of $GOD the mobsters earn from taxes. Bosses and Dwarfathers are also the
                rarest and most unique in terms of art. In phase one, each boss is animated and each
                Dwarfather was hand-drawn from scratch by our lead artist Butcher Billy. If you’re lucky
                enough to mint one of those, it might be your retirement project.</p>
              <p>Six mobster clans will be introduced during phase one, each one controls a different
                city. Three additional clans will be revealed during every new drop happening in phase
                two.</p>

              <p>All merchants and mobsters will need to join the Dwarfather they trust the most.
                The previous clans will be dissolved. Mobsters can choose to either stay with their
                current Dwarfather or switch for one of their choices. Mobsters and merchants from
                every city will mix to create new clans. Dwarfathers have for objective to protect
                those who join them and attack opposing clans. May the most ruthless, strategic, and
                dominant clan win.</p> */}
              {/* <h3>GAME SUMMARY</h3>
              <p>- 1’810’000’000 $GOD is for the taking in GOD WAR</p>
              <p>- Dwarfathers are leaders of merchants and mobsters and aim to win a max of $GOD
                during the GOD WAR.</p>
              <p>- Merchants and Mobsters decide which dwarfather to join. Clans with the most
                Merchant and Mobsters staked in them earn more points during the competition.</p>
              <p>- When staking $GOD, Clans earn influence points to start a Vendetta or Protect their
                clan. The more $GOD a clan accumulates in staking, the quicker the clan will
                receive a new influence point. Only one unused influence point can be kept at a
                time.</p>
              <h3>DURING GOD WAR</h3>
              <p>1. A Dwarfather can stake and lead a clan until a deadline is announced by the
                Consigliere. A Dwarfather is never allowed to leave its Clan. Dwarfathers are not
                permitted to unstake until the end of GOD WAR.</p>
              <p>2. All other mobsters and merchants can decide to stake and join another Clan at any
                point during GOD WAR.</p>
              <p>3. Clans will be awarded $GOD based on the total number of points they collected.</p>
              <h3>GIMME THE LOOT</h3>
              <p>1,810,000,000 $GOD total can be won during GOD WAR.

              <p>In the case of having less than 15 Dwarfathers competing in GOD war, the remaining
                $GOD price will be burnt.</p>
              <p>Example: only 13 Dwarfathers compete, the 14th and 15th place prizes (4.2% in total)
                will be burned.</p>
              <p>The Dwarfathers in each clan will get 5% of their Clan’s winnings to reward their
                commitment towards making their Clan prosper. The rest of the 95% of the Clan’s
                $GOD winnings will be claimable by individual wallet addresses proportional to the
                contributions they made to the Clan they are part of when the game finishes.</p>
              <h3>CLAIM AMOUNTS</h3>
              <p>The price attributed to each player will be distributed according to the following factors:</p>
              <p>- 50% by the number of points they earned through staking their merchants and
                mobsters</p>
              <p>- 50% by the amount and duration of $GOD that they staked</p>
              <p>Example: A player contributes 4% of their Clan’s points and 5% of their Clan’s $GOD,
                they would earn 4.5% of the Clan’s $GOD prize.</p>
              <p>ATTENTION: If a player unstakes a merchant or mobster or moves to another
                Clan, the NFT’s points will be reset to 0 and all GOD earnings to be given to the
                old Clan are canceled.</p>
              <h3>STAKING AND POINTS</h3>
              <p>The Dwarfathers have one objective: to collect as many points as possible for their
                clans. A mobster or merchant can be part of only one clan at a time but they can choose
                to switch clans at any time, with a cost.</p>
              <p>Each Merchant or Mobster staked in a Clan contributes a number of daily points to its
                Clan. Mobsters earn points proportionally to their rank within their Clan.</p>

                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>As an example: a Clan with 800 Merchants, 120 Soldiers, 30 capos and 3 bosses would
                earn 800 * 200 + 120 * 400 + 30 * 700 + 3 * 1400 = 233’200 Points daily.</p>
              <p>If you want to move merchants and mobsters into another clan during the GOD War or
                unstake at any time, the points earned for the former Clan will stay with them and be
                added to their total points count. On the other hand, you will erase your own Merchant
                and Mobster points. Any $GOD you would have earned by staying with your previous
                Clan will be burned at the end of GOD War.</p>
              <h3>INFLUENCE POINTS: DECLARE A VENDETTA OR PROTECT YOUR CLAN</h3>
              <p>Clans win Influence points by staking $GOD. The Dwarfathers are the only ones who
                can make the decisions to use these Influence points to either Protect their Clan or
                declare a Vendetta on other another Clan.</p>
              <p>Each time a Clan earns an Influence point, it is the responsibility of the Dwarfather of
                that clan to use the Influence point before the Clan earns another Influence point. A
                Clan cannot collect Influence points, as it is allowed to keep only one unused Influence
                point at a time.</p>
              <h4>The two options for each Influence point won:</h4>
              <p>1) Declare a Vendetta on another Clan to diminish that clan’s total points by 3% if they
                have no Protection.</p>
              <p>2) Protect to strengthen the Clan against a Vendetta.</p>
              <h3>INFLUENCE POINTS MATHS</h3>
              <p>If a Clan has no Protections, then Vendettas against that Clan will diminish the Clan’s
                points by 3%. No limitations are imposed on the number of Protections a Clan is
                allowed to make.</p>
              <p>Example 1: Your Clan has 2’000’000 points and 0 Protections. If another Clan declares
                a Vendetta on you, your Clan’s points will go to 1’940’000.</p>
              <p>Example 2: Your Clan has 2’000’000 points and 2 Protections. Another Clan declares a
                Vendetta on you: your Clan’s points remain 2’000’000 but 1 Protection is used to protect
                your Clan and you only have 1 left.</p>
              <h3>WINING INFLUENCE POINTS</h3>
              <p>Influence points are won by staking $GOD. Every time an Influence point is earned, the
                Dwarfather needs to decide if his Clan wants to declare a Vendetta or add Protection
                before the Clan can win more Influence points. Only one Influence point can ever be
                kept by one Clan at the same time.</p>
              <p>Influence points are won based on the amount of $GOD they are able to stake. In order
                for the game to remain fun, the bigger clans need more $GOD to win Influence points
                than the smaller ones.</p>
              <p>Days to earn an Influence point = (Clan’s daily points rate * 300) / Total $GOD staked in
                Clan</p>
              <p>The GOD WAR will end when the Consigliere decides. May the best clan win.</p> */}
